Sublime Shortcuts

Sublime has a lot of shortcuts that can help you speed up your development process. 
Check out an overview of the shortcuts for Mac 
http://www.cheatography.com/martinprins/cheat-sheets/sublime-text-3-osx/ and 
for Windows 
https://gist.github.com/eteanga/1736542.</pre>
                  <pre>There are a lot of stock photos on the internet. Here is a list of great sources for photos.
https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b</pre>
                  <pre>Bootstrap already has normalize.css included, but since, 
for now, you are not using Bootstrap, go ahead and download the normalize.css file from here 
https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/</pre>
                  <pre>Direct Descendants: While a space between selectors will cause your code to select all elements 
inside the first one, the direct descendant selector > will only select the direct children of an element. 
                  
For example, this selector .classname>p {}

Attributes: You can even select HTML elements by their attribute (with or without value) using square brackets. 
[href] {} will select all elements with an href attribute. 
[href="http://google.com"] will only select those elements that have an href attribute and the value http://google.com</pre>

                  <pre>If auto is used as a margin (left and right in our example), 
it will use the remaining space and divide it evenly between the two 
(so the left and right margins will each take up 10% of the page width in our example), 
effectively centering the element.</pre>
                  
                  <pre>Positioning
There are 4 types of positioning in CSS you can use with the syntax:

selector {
    position: relative;
}


Static is the default positioning. The element is in the flow of document. That is, elements 
will appear one after the other in the order they're listed in your HTML file. Properties like 
left, right, top, and bottom have no effect.



Relative positioning means the element is where it would normally be in the flow of the 
document, but you can change its position with properties like left, right, top, and bottom.



Absolute positioning places the element at an exact location on the screen with regard to its 
parent element, which is usually html or a container div. It can be defined with top, bottom, 
left, and right. The values express distance from the top, bottom, left, or right edge of the 
parent element.



Fixed elements are like absolute, but they are defined relative to the browser window, so they 
stay in the specified position even when the user scrolls. Fixed position is used to keep things 
like sidebar navigation or footers in place (check out how the CareerFoundry sidebar menu always 
stays in place as you scroll).

Here's a JSfiddle where you can view some code and play with these. Change the size of the 
browser window to see how each element adjusts or stays put.

http://jsfiddle.net/juliahimmel/xv9szr1m/embedded/result%2Chtml%2Ccss/

</pre>



                  <pre>inline-block works in a similar way to "inline", however, it will treat both elements as 
individual boxes and put those in line. The top and bottom margin and padding of an element will 
definitely affect an element's position if you use inline-block.</pre>



                  <pre>Glyphicons are not actually images. They are an icon font, a custom font that uses glyphs 
instead of letters.

You can add transitions to glyphicons using pseudo-classes, just as you did for the hover effect 
on your links. 

Refer to Exercise 6 to add hover properties to the glyphicons. 

We can add these hover properties because glyphicons are considered to be part of text, rather 
than images.

</pre>

                  <pre>http://apps.pixlr.com/editor/</pre>

                  <pre>You'll have to crop these images with an image editing software so they are the exact same 
size. Otherwise, your carousel will “jump” or shift places when your user clicks on the next 
image. We recommend cropping them to 1920 x 1080px, one of the largest browser screen sizes. 


After you have cropped your image, save it by following the directions from the previous 
section.</pre>

                  <pre>Navigation Bar Disappearing
If you cannot see your navigation bar at this point, it’s probably BEHIND your image carousel. 
You have two options to solve this problem.

You can add margin or padding the same size as the navigation bar to the top your image carousel 
to push it down further on the page. For example, let’s say our navigation bar (.nav) has a 
height of 65px. Give the carousel ID (#carousel-example-generic) a padding-top of 65px as well.

If you want the image carousel to stay in the same position (because you might want the 
navigation bar to be transparent in front of your image carousel), you can give your navigation 
a CSS property called z-index.

The order in which elements stack (meaning, overlap each other) on a website is determined by 
the z-index property. An element’s default z-index is usually 0. To change the stacking order so 
an element appears in front of another, use the z-index property and give it an integer value 
such as 1. By doing this, we will change its stacking order so that it will be stacked on top of 
our carousel.

.nav {
  z-index: 1;
}

Read more about the z-index property here.

Image Carousel Too Small
Your carousel being inside a "container" div may also be causing you problems because the 
container class includes margins on the sides. To solve this problem, replace "container" with 
"container-fluid".

"Container" is a Bootstrap class that creates a responsive, fixed-width “container” or box for 
your HTML elements. “Container-fluid” is a Bootstrap class that will make the container fit the 
width of the page. If you are still seeing padding on the sides, it’s because Bootstrap sets 
container-fluid with a default of 15px padding on the left and right. This is part of 
Bootstrap's powerful grid system which you are going to learn about in the next exercise. Since 
in this situation you don't want to use the grid system but instead want the carousel to cover 
the full width you can counteract that default styling by applying a margin of -15px on both 
sides of the carousel.

div class="container-fluid">

...

/div

If you would like your carousel to cover the full width of your website, here is a reminder of 
how to write the CSS:



.carousel {

margin-left: -15px;

margin-right: -15px;

}

Keep in mind that if you were to use multiple carousels on your website, now every single 
carousel will have a margin-left and margin-right of -15px. If you know you will use multiple 
carousels it might be a good idea to apply an ID to your carousel and use that CSS rule only on 
that ID.</pre>
                  
                  <pre>
In this Exercise, you will not be writing media queries. We like the ones the Bootstrap team has already defined, so we'll be using 
those. However, let's take a closer look to show you how they are created in CSS. In your CSS file, add this code at the bottom:

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  body {
    background-color: red;
  }
}

Remember, CSS is cascading. If you have the same CSS rule with a different color below the media query in the CSS file, the lower one 
will be applied and the media query will be ignored.

Now, reload your website. Everything should still look the same. But now resize your browser window to become as thin as possible. 
Notice how when the browser is less than 480px wide, the background-color of your website will suddenly become red? That's how media 
queries work. Go ahead and delete the code we just created since we won't be using it.

How many breakpoints does a web designer need to use? In general, every responsive website has a minimum of two breakpoints: one for 
tablets and one for mobile devices.</pre>
                  <pre>
We don't need to specify col-lg-3 for large screens because 
Bootstrap is "mobile first" and the 3 of col-md-3 will also be applied to large screens.

Keep the following rules in mind, since not following them will most certainly mess up your layout:

Never put an element with the class .container or .container-fluid inside another element with the same classes. You can't nest 
containers inside containers!

Always pay attention to use all classes in the right order:

.col- elements need to be inside a .row
.row elements need to be inside a .container or .container-fluid

LAYING OUT AROUND THE BOOTSTRAP GRID SYSTEM

Don't change the padding for the .col- class itself. In fact, you should be really careful with changing anything about the classes of 
the Bootstrap grid system (.container(-fluid), .row, .col-*). You will use these classes throughout your whole project and if you 
change one of them, you will see that change everywhere on your website where you use that class. This will very likely mess up your 
whole layout at some point.

The safest way to add padding, margins, height, width, and more, to elements inside the grid system is to create a new div inside the 
div with your grid class (e.g. .col-sm-6), give it its own class, and add the padding to that class.</pre>
                  <pre>Responsive Images and Text

One of the challenges of mobile phones is that everything is smaller. So how do you make your images and text smaller as your browser 
size shrinks as well?

There's one easy fix: add the Bootstrap responsive image class to your img tag.

img="yourimage.jpg" class="img-responsive"

If you look at the existing Bootstrap code, you will find that this class already adds the following properties to help your images 
scale down proportionately in smaller devices:

.img-responsive {
  display: block;
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
 }
Don't add this code since Bootstrap has it already defined for you.

For text, it's important to continue to use relative sizing; ems instead of pixels, for example. Remember that setting the size in ems 
cause the size of the text to change proportionately based on what the browser defines as 1em. This will be a different size for each 
device based on screen size, and, lucky for you, the change will then cascade through your entire design and you won't have to do a 
thing. (If you really want, you can change the base size of your text by putting a different size on the body element.)

Look at your CSS code and see if you can replace any pixels with ems. You can also use percentages instead of fixed pixel counts to set 
the height and width of images to allow them to maintain their proportions relative to the rest of your page on a smaller screen</pre>

                  <pre>Utility Classes

You can make your assets appear (or disappear) depending on your browser size with utility classes. Examine the chart here 
http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities to determine which elements will appear (or disappear) at various screen sizes. For 
example, in mobile sizes, navigation bars or large images may be hidden.

</pre>
                  <pre>ATTENTION!
Watch out not to have multiple elements with the class container or container-fluid within each other. Bootstrap's "container(-fluid)" 
classes are not meant to be nested inside other "container(-fluid)" classes. Doing so will mess up your layout!</pre>
                  <pre>OVERWRITING BOOTSTRAP CLASSES
Using Bootstrap's navbar component comes also with a downside. Some of their styles are very 
specific and if you want to change them you will have to write very specific CSS as well.

Take a look at the :hover effect on the different links in your navigation, for example. Open 
the Developer Tools, inspect the a tag and above the CSS on the right in the Developer Tools 
click on the little pin symbol. This will open up a new menu in which you can select various 
pseudo classes, one of which is :hover. Go ahead and select it. Now you should notice a new CSS 
rule showing up. One of the selectors looks like this: nav>li>a:hover This is the selector you 
will have to use in order to overwrite Bootstrap's default styling.</pre>
         <pre>Add HTML5 Validations
With HTML5, there are several attributes we can add to our input types to require certain character types or length of characters.

Many input tags are so semantic that just adding the input type helps validate what is typed into the box. For example, when you use 
input type=&rdquo;email&rdquo;, your browser will look for an @ (among other things) to make sure the user types in a valid email 
address. Also, on mobile keyboards, when the browser sees the email tag, it will automatically make the @ key visible to the user. Very 
helpful!



Add attribute required=&rdquo;required&rdquo; to make the email address and message required fields. If the user attempts to submit the 
form without that field filled in, their browser will notify them that the field is required in order to proceed.



To help your user understand how to fill out the form correctly, add an asterisk (*) to the labels of the text fields that will be 
required. You can add a &ldquo;title&rdquo; attribute to your inputs. When the user hovers over these, the value of the title tag will 
appear as a tooltip and give the user more information.



Minimum and Maximum Length



You can specify minimum and maximum character lengths for an &lt;input&gt; element for input types of:

- text
- email
- search
- password
- tel
- url
- textarea element
using the minlength and maxlength attributes.

For all other input types, minlength is ignored. minlength exists only for HTML5; however, it is not yet compatible on all browsers.

For example:

&lt;textarea minlength=20&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;input type=text minlength=10&gt;
TEXTAREA
Make sure to have no line breaks or spaces between the textarea opening and closing tags. Everything that's between the opening and 
closing tags will be displayed as content of the textarea on your website (including line breaks, tabs and spaces in the code).

Don't confuse this with the max and min attributes, which work with the following input types:

- number
- date
- datetime
- datetime-local
- month
- time
- week

You can use the max and min attributes to create a range of valid values.

You may notice that some websites ask users to input their birthday in a form when they sign up. These often have min or max values to 
ensure that users are above the age of 13 for sites like Facebook and other online communities.

For example:

Enter your birthday below.
&lt;input type=&quot;date&quot; name=&quot;bday&quot; max=&quot;1979-12-31&quot;&gt;
min and max lengths are relatively new HTML5 attributes, and not all browser will support them equally.</pre>   
                  <pre>
Next we are going to use jQuery to select the div with the class row and the ID works (your ID might be different). Then we will use 
the jQuery function .append() to add HTML content to our DOM inside that div. append() will add the content below all the other 
content, that might already exist inside that div. .prepend() would add it before the other content. html() would replace all content 
inside the div.</pre>
                  
                  <pre>More Event Listeners

So far, we have used the on() method and passed a “click” event when we wanted something to happen upon clicking. jQuery also has some convenience methods that already include the event, leaving you only to pass in the handler function. Here, for example, is the .click() method that contains a click event. As you might have guessed, a click event occurs when a user clicks on an HTML element.

$("element").click( function() {
  // do something when “element” is clicked
});
Others include onload(), keyup(), keypress(), and the ones we’ll be using today: mouseenter() and mouseleave().

We want the word “Title” and the title of the project to appear over each image when we hover over it, and to disappear when we stop hovering. Since we've already added the titles to the images, we are going to hide them and then use the jQuery function show() and hide() to only display them when they are being hovered over.

First, add this CSS property to your .info class rule to hide the titles:

display: none;
If you refresh the page now, the titles shouldn't be visible anymore.

Selecting the div by its class using jQuery, applying the mouseenter() method to it, and passing a handler function as an argument to this method should be no problem for you at this point.

$(".work-img").mouseenter( function() {
});
Inside the handler function, we want to only show the .info div of the image we are currently hovering over, not all the divs with the class “info”. How do we let the browser know we just mean that one div? Use the this keyword. Remember, the this keyword refers to the object a function is being called on. In the context of jQuery, that’s the object triggering the event. Let’s test this, as we have done before, using console.log to make sure that our code is acting correctly.

$(".work-img").mouseenter( function() {
  console.log(this);
});
What does this refer to? Save, reload, open your Console, hover on the images, and check it out!

this, in our situation, refers to the anchor tag. What we need is the span tag with the class of "info" inside this anchor tag. this does not work like a regular descendant selector like the ones we have used before. But jQuery still makes it easy for us to select an element inside this. All we need is to write the following code:

$(".info", this)
This will select all HTML elements with the class "info" inside this element. Now, we can just use the show() function on it to display the title:

$(".work-img").mouseenter( function() {
  $(".info", this).show();
});
So far, so good. Save and refresh, then check it. Now, let’s remove the text when the mouse leaves the div with the .mouseleave method. We can chain jQuery event methods together to do this. Check it out:

$(".work-img").mouseenter(function(){
  $(".info", this).show();
}).mouseleave(function(){
  $(".info", this).hide();
});
Your text should now only appear when the mouse is hovering over the particular div. Fantastic work! We know there was a lot here, and you have done a great job following along closely. As always, ask your mentor if you need any clarification to help.

</pre>
                  <pre>Now you need an API key. Go ahead and click on "Register". This will bring you to specific instructions on how to obtain an API key.

WHAT’S AN API KEY?
An API key is a unique password that identifies us to a company (in this case, Google, authorizing us for use of Google Maps data.) Companies request that developers get API keys to control the flow of requests to their server (so as to not slow their databases down) and to prevent misuse of the Terms of Service. API keys involve JavaScript—nothing that we haven’t seen before!
Read and follow the instructions in only that paragraph. (Note: You need to log into your Google account to generate and access API keys.)

Leave the field under "Accept requests from these HTTP referrers (web sites)" empty for now. Once you know which domain you will use the Maps API on, you can add it here to make sure nobody else can use your API key on their own websites. This would be very important once your website has more users!</pre>
